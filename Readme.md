This is for the frontend challenge.

Specification:
Node.JS Version:    v20.13.1
    - Other dependencies are written in package.json. You may see it there.
    Also, the Node.JS type is a Module not common JS

Overview
    JS framework: React
    CSS framework: TailwindCSS
    Bundler: Webpack
    
For the project to start use the command:
|> npm run dev
    Now the project is available at     http://localhost:8000


NOTES:
Things in helpers directory are ALL of my self made helpers I created long ago to solve some misbehaving problems in javascript.

You may notice that some configuration like in webpack.config.js have comments. Those comments are written by me long ago so that installing react from scratch is streamline.

The resources files is located at public/storage. I assume that this is supposedly an image from backend storage so I named it public/storage.
    I also found it that the "tmsph-logo.jpg" is missing in resources although it is available in get request of https://tmsph-sdi-challenges.pages.dev/challenges/authors.json. What I did is find a logo online that fits with the brand.
